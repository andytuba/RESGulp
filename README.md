Gulpfile for RES Building

**Please**  do not distribute your own binaries of RES (e.g. with bugfixes, etc). The version numbers in RES are important references for tech support so that we can replicate bugs that users report using the same version they are, and when you distribute your own - you run the risk of polluting/confusing that. In addition, if a user overwrites his/her extension with your distributed copy, it may not properly retain their RES settings/data depending on the developer ID used, etc.
